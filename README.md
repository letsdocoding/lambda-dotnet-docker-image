# AWS Lambda (serverless) with dotnet5 based container (docker) image 
In this video we shall be deploying AWS Lambda using Dotnet Core 5 based Docker image. We would be using the Dotnet Core 5 to built the WebAPI, then create a docker image and publish to ECR. Once the image is published to AWS Elastic Container Registry or ECR, we shall continue and deploy the lambda from this image and shall update the image and then lambda thereafter. 

The container image are new features that allows docker images to be used for container images. We shall also see some more advanced options to save time and improve performance such as batching.
